FRONT END - A web-based dice game featuring a randomized outcome and a single winner. The game utilized JavaScript to generate random numbers and determine the winner, while HTML and CSS were used to create a visually appealing user interface. I also implemented a refresh function, allowing users to roll the dice and play the game again.
